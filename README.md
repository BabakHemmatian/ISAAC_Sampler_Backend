# ISAAC Sampler (Backend)

This repository contains the backend scripts for [this website](https://isaac.psychology.illinois.edu/). The website allows users to access and download data from the **Illinois Social Attitudes Aggregate Corpus (ISAAC)**, a comprehensive dataset of Reddit discourse from 2007 to 2023 about social groups defined by race, skin tone, weight, sexuality, age and ability.

**Note:** Frontend scripts, as well as more information about the app and its setup, can be found [here](https://github.com/BabakHemmatian/ISAAC_Sampler). Corpus development tools are located within [this repository](https://github.com/BabakHemmatian/Illinois_Social_Attitudes).
